# synthetic-1d-lunar-crater-outlines
This python script generates the rim crest, floor, and rim flank outlines of craters with diameters defined by diameter_array.
Note that: By setting the random seed to a certain value, the same crater will be generated each time. If random craters need to be generated, just comment out the random seed.
